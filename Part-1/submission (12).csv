1,"Based on Table 1-2 and the surrounding text, the global economic crisis around 2008 was sparked by a housing price decline that escalated into a major financial crisis. The text states, ""As housing prices continued to decline, it became clear that many of the mortgage loans that had been given out during the earlier expansion were of poor quality."" This led to a chain reaction where banks faced uncertainty about the value of their assets, causing a reluctance to lend to each other. The text further explains, ""This complexity and opaqueness turned a housing price decline into a major financial crisis, a development that very few economists had anticipated.",5
2,"Based on Table 1-2 and the surrounding text, we can see the significant impact of unemployment rates on the economy. The text states, ""Output did not grow in 2008 and declined by 3.5% in 2009. Unemployment increased dramatically, to nearly 10%."" Furthermore, it mentions, ""Since then, however, growth has decreased again, becoming so weak that unemployment is forecast to remain high for a long time to come."" This highlights the detrimental effects of high unemployment rates on economic growth and stability.",5
3,"Based on Table 1-1 and the surrounding text, the text provides insight into how economists measure economic growth without price changes affecting it. The table shows output growth rates for the world economy, advanced economies, and other countries separately since 2000. It highlights the annual average world output growth of 3.2%, with advanced economies growing at 2.6% per year and emerging and developing economies at 6.5% per year. The text also discusses the impact of the 2007 financial crisis on output growth, stating that ""In 2007, signs that the expansion might be coming to an end started to appear."" This demonstrates how economic growth can be analyzed independently of price changes.",1
4,"Based on Table 1-2 and the surrounding text, the world economy was significantly impacted during the 2009 recession. The text states, ""Output did not grow in 2008 and declined by 3.5% in 2009. Unemployment increased dramatically, to nearly 10%. Inflation declined, being slightly negative in 2009 and then staying positive but low since then."" Additionally, it mentions, ""The economy rebounded in 2010, with growth of 3%. Since then, however, growth has decreased again, becoming so weak that unemployment is forecast to remain high for a long time to come."" This indicates the severity of the recession and its lingering effects on the economy.",5
5,"Based on Table 1-2 and the surrounding text, we can see the impact of the 2008 crisis on U.S. unemployment. The text states, ""Output did not grow in 2008 and declined by 3.5% in 2009. Unemployment increased dramatically, to nearly 10%."" Additionally, it mentions, ""Since then, however, growth has decreased again, becoming so weak that unemployment is forecast to remain high for a long time to come."" This indicates a significant rise in unemployment following the 2008 crisis, with lingering effects on the labor market forecasted for the future.",5
6,"Based on Table 1-4 and the surrounding text, China's economy experienced impressive growth rates before and during the crisis. The text states, ""Look at the first two columns of Table 1-4. The most impressive numbers are those for output growth. Since 1980, China’s output has grown at roughly 10% a year."" Additionally, it mentions, ""Growth has barely decreased, and unemployment has barely increased since 2007. The reason is not that China is closed to the rest of the world. Chinese exports slowed during the crisis. But the adverse effect on demand was nearly fully offset by a major fiscal expansion by the Chinese government."" This sustained growth is attributed to high accumulation of capital and rapid technological progress, making China a significant player in the global economy.",10
7,"Based on Figure 1-1 and the surrounding text, ""Stock prices collapsed. Figure 1-1 plots the evolution of three stock price indexes, for the United States, for the Euro area, and for emerging economies, from the beginning of 2007 on. The indexes are set equal to 1 in January 2007. Note how, by the end of 2008, stock prices had lost half or more of their value from their previous peak. Note also that, despite the fact that the crisis originated in the United States, European and emerging market stock prices decreased by as much as their U.S. counterparts.",2
8,"Based on Table 1-2 and the surrounding text, we can see the relationship between economic growth and unemployment in the United States. The text states, ""Output did not grow in 2008 and declined by 3.5% in 2009. Unemployment increased dramatically, to nearly 10%."" This indicates that during periods of economic decline, such as the one experienced in 2008-2009, unemployment tends to rise. Additionally, the text mentions, ""Since then, however, growth has decreased again, becoming so weak that unemployment is forecast to remain high for a long time to come."" This suggests that even with some economic growth, high unemployment levels may persist.",5
9,"Based on Figure 2-4 and the surrounding text, the relationship between consumer prices and overall economic prices in the U.S. is discussed. The text states, ""The CPI and the GDP deflator move together most of the time. In most years, the two inflation rates differ by less than 1%."" Additionally, it mentions, ""But there are clear exceptions. In 1979 and 1980, the increase in the CPI was significantly larger than the increase in the GDP deflator."" This discrepancy is explained by the fact that the CPI reflects the price of goods consumed in the U.S., while the GDP deflator reflects the price of goods produced in the U.S.",14
10,"Based on Figure 1-5 and the surrounding text, the Euro area has faced challenges with high unemployment even before the crisis. The text states, ""Even during the pre-crisis period, from 2000 to 2007, the Euro area was not doing very well compared to the United States. Output growth was lower than in the United States over the same period. Unemployment was substantially higher than in the United States."" Additionally, the text highlights the struggle with unemployment, mentioning, ""The increase in European unemployment since 2007 is primarily due to the crisis, and it is reasonable to expect that the unemployment rate will eventually return to its pre-crisis level. But this pre-crisis level was already high, 8.5% for the Euro area over the period 2000–2007.",8
11,"Based on Table 1-4 and the surrounding text, China managed to keep growing strong through the 2008 crisis due to various factors. The text highlights that ""growth has barely decreased, and unemployment has barely increased since 2007"" in China. This was achieved through a major fiscal expansion by the Chinese government, particularly through a significant increase in public investment. The sustained growth performance was supported by high accumulation of capital, with China's investment rate exceeding 40% of output, and rapid technological progress by encouraging foreign firms to relocate and produce in China. This strategy led to increased productivity and output, contributing to China's continuous growth.",10
